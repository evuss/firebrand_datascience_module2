We are using the package called recommenderlab. You convert all ratings into one of the marix, mostly to binary. If we are using ratings data and people are rating some things low, we probably would like to transform ratings data. Most of the code comes from https://lockedata.co.uk/firebrandmodule2/recommendations

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(recommenderlab)

data(MovieLense)
image(MovieLense)

model <- Recommender(MovieLense,method="POPULAR")
as(predict(model, MovieLense[101], n = 10),"list") #the aslist only gives this as an info of topNlist for the user [101]

# Try on Jester5k data
data("Jester5k")
pop_norm_model <- Jester5k %>% normalize() %>% Recommender("POPULAR", parameter = list(normalize = NULL))

Jester5k %>% 
  evaluationScheme("split",train=.85,given=3) -> 
  eval_split

eval_split %>% 
  getData("train") %>% 
  Recommender("SVD")-> 
  svd_simple

eval_split %>% 
  getData("known") %>% 
  predict(svd_simple, ., type="ratings") %>% 
  calcPredictionAccuracy(getData(eval_split,"unknown"))

# Cross validation
Jester5k %>% 
  evaluationScheme("cross-validation",k=10,given=3)->
  eval_cv

eval_cv %>% 
  evaluate("SVD", type="ratings") ->
  svd_cv_e

svd_cv_e %>% 
  getConfusionMatrix() %>% 
  map_df(as.data.frame)
  
getModel(pop_norm_model)$topN

pop_norm_model %>% 
  predict(normalize(Jester5k)[1001],n=10) %>% 
  bestN(3) %>% 
  as("list")

```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
