Initial exploration of data

```{r}
library(DataExplorer)
IBMSurvey
DataExplorer::create_report(IBMSurvey, output_file = "IBM.html")

#Lots of variables that needs to be transformed to factors

IBMSurvey %>% 
  mutate_if(~is.numeric(.)&n_distinct(.)<7, factor) %>% 
  mutate_if(is.character,factor) ->IBMSurvey
  


```
# Split data
```{r}
library(rsample) # makes us do samples of our data, by using training() and testing()
library(recipes)

IBMSurvey %>%
initial_split(prop = .9) ->
ibm_split

ibm_split %>% 
  training() -> ibm_train

ibm_split %>% 
  training() -> ibm_train

```
# Manipulation Data
```{r}
#Scaling/basics process
ibm_train %>%
  recipe(MonthlyIncome ~ ., .) %>% 
  step_center(all_numeric()) %>% 
  step_scale(all_numeric()) %>%
  prep(training=ibm_train) ->
  ibm_preprocess # save as preprocessing step that we then can use for baking purposes

ibm_preprocess %>% 
  bake(ibm_train) -> ibm_train_prepr
```
#Modelling
